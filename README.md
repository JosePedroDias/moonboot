# moonboot

this is a lua2d game bootstrap with moonscript for osx development


## what it does already

* maximize screen to desired resolution (screen.moon)
* standardize mouse and touch into common callbacks (mouseAndTouch.moon)
* dumb test with custom font, circle drawing and click and sfx playback, also file i/o


## ongoing

* 2D matrix class without side-effects (i.e., changes return new instances)
